================================================================================================

Interface to the device's In-App Purchase system.


This interface was designed to be dropped into any game that needs support for in-app purchases,
that is, there is nothing game-specific about this interface or its implementation.

It is essentially a singleton implemented in the idInAppPurchase namespace. The singleton must
be initialized at application launch (via Initialize()) and shut down at application exit (via
Shutdown()).

There are functions to request information about products for sale within the app, check whether
a particular product has been purchased, and get the localized price for a product, suitable
for displaying in the user interface.

Generally an app should call RequestInformation() at startup (but after Initialize()) and pass
in all the product identifiers that the app offers for sale. The request will run in the
background so that the interface will remain responsive. Once the requests have been returned,
the application can get the price information and actually initiate purchases of products.
